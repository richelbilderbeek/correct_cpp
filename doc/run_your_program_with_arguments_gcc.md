# [Run your program with arguments](run_your_program_with_arguments.md), using GCC/`g++`

After [doing the exercise using GCC](do_the_exercise_gcc.md) you get an executable called `a.out` by default.

You can run your program with arguments by typing these after the call to the excutable, seperated by spaces.
If you want to supply a single argument with spaces, surround it with quotes.

## Examples

No arguments:

```
./a.out
```

One argument, `hello`:

```
./a.out hello
```

Two arguments, `hello` and `world`:

```
./a.out hello world
```

One argument, `hello world`:

```
./a.out "hello world"
```
