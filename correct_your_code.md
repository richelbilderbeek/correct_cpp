# Correct your code

There are two ways to correct your code:

 * [Correct your GitHub](correct_your_github.md)
    * :expressionless: Need to create a Travis CI account (which is free/gratis)
    * :relaxed: Travis CI works on your GitHub
    * :smirk: You can [use the scoreboard](use_the_scoreboard.md)
 * [Do a pull request](do_a_pull_request.md)
    * :pensive: No need for a Travis CI account
    * :expressionless: Pull requests must be created
    * :unamused: Pull requests will be rejected
